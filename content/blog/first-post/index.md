After reading Dan Abramov's post on setting up his own blog, I've decided to follow suit and startup a blog on my own site. So here it is, complete with first post. Not exactly sure what all I will be posting here, but there will certainly be software development, probably a sprinkling of mechanical keyboard stuff, house projects, and maybe even some lifestyle stuff from time to time. I'm mostly looking to just share what I learn a bit more. I've always been reluctant to do so due to my own imposter syndrome, and this is really step one towards getting past that. Alright, so here we go. Wish me luck.
